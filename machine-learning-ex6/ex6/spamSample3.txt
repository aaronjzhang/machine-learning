Hi @aaronjzhang_
We want to help you get more out of Twitter.

It’s important to know what your company or project is “all about”, but coming up with a concise story or tagline when you’re neck-deep in said company or project can be baffling.

Here are some techniques:

Be conversational. Describe your story in the same language a customer would use to describe your business to a friend.

Use a timeline. Explaining how you got started, and why, and what you’ve been up to since then.

Showcase founders. Use the story of the people who started or grew the brand to imply the values you hold today.

For more on getting your “about us” in shape, see our article on interesting ways to share your brand story.
